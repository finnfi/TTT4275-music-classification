# TTT4275 music classification
By Tarek El-Agroudi and Finn Gross Maurer.

This repository contains the full code base created for this project. The scripts can be found in the scripts folder.

A jupyter notebook has been created to go through the code part-by-part. This runs online on a binder server, so python is not required. This can be opened by clicking the button/link below. 

Run from binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/finnfi/TTT4275-music-classification/main?labpath=Code_part_by_part.ipynb)

If running the scripts from computer is prefered (we strongly recomment binder), the requirements can be installed from the requirements.txt file.
